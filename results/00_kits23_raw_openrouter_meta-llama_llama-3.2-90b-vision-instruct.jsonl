The key features of a tumor typically include:\n\n*   **Location**: The renal cortex (outer layer) is the most common location for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which includes clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe subtypes. Angiomyolipomas are also typically found in the renal cortex.\n*   **Density**: Renal tumors can vary in density, with some appearing as a low-density mass (hypodensity) and others being of higher density (hyperdensity). The density can provide clues about the type of tumor.\n*   **Border**: The border of the tumor, whether it is well-defined or ill-defined, can indicate its aggressiveness and type. A clear, sharp border is more typical of benign tumors like angiomyolipomas, while an irregular border might suggest a more aggressive malignancy.\n\nGiven that the tumor is described as being in the renal cortex and having a well-defined border without specifying its density, we need additional details to accurately classify it among the provided options. However, based on the general characteristics:\n\n*   **Clear Cell RCC**: Typically appears hypodense due to the presence of lipid-rich cytoplasm in the clear cells. This is the most common type of renal cell carcinoma.\n*   **Papillary RCC**: Often presents as a well-defined, homogeneous mass without significant contrast enhancement, but it can also be more complex with cystic components or septa.\n*   **Chromophobe RCC**: Characterized by large, pale cells but usually has a well-defined margin, and imaging features are often non-specific.\n*   **Angiomyolipoma**: Contains fat and is typically well-defined, hypointense on T1-weighted MRI images due to the fat content, and very high signal intensity (hyperintense) on T2-weighted images.\n\nWithout specific details on the tumor's density or signal characteristics in MRI scans, which could help differentiate between these types based on fat content or other cellular characteristics, it's challenging to provide a definitive classification.\n\nGiven the information and common renal tumor characteristics, the most likely prediction without clear evidence of a specific subtype's characteristics would lean towards either clear cell RCC, considering its prevalence, or angiomyolipoma based on the description of a well-defined border, though both lack specificity without further imaging details.\n\n**{'y_pred': 'angiomyolipoma', 'explanation': 'Well-defined borders are common in angiomyolipomas, and the location in the renal cortex aligns with known characteristics of this benign tumor type.

Yoon et al. state that clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is a solid mass and nearly isodense to normal renal parenchyma.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that the exact nature of the tumor cannot be ascertained without pathologic examination, considering that the clinical significance of the renal masses relies significantly on their malignant potential. Various studies suggest that the results can help clinicians in formulating a proper differential diagnosis by combining the results with the patient's clinical history and physical examination.

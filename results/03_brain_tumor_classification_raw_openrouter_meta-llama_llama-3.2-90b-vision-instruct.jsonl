Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They are usually benign (non-cancerous) but can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive impairment due to their location and size."}

The tumor is located in the cerebral hemisphere and has a irregular shape, which is typical of glioma tumors. The MRI image also shows that the tumor is surrounded by edema, which is a common feature of glioma tumors."}

The tumor is isodense to slightly hyperdense on T1-weighted images and shows intense contrast enhancement, consistent with a meningioma. There is no evidence of edema or mass effect, which is also consistent with a meningioma."}
